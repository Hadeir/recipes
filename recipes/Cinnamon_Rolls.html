    <p>Cinnamon rolls hold a special place in my heart. As a mostly savory breakfast person who always craves a little something sweet, I know I can count on a cinnamon roll to satisfy that need. In fact, whenever my sisters and I go out to brunch, there’s an unspoken understanding that we’ll order a cinnamon roll for the table. That way, we can each dig into our own savory entrees and still get that satisfying bite of warm, sugary goodness.</p>
    <p>But in addition to getting my sweet brunch-date fix,  I’ve also tried to bake them from scratch, looking for the perfect recipe. I’ve tried store-bought shortcuts, new techniques, and surprising mix-ins, but no single recipe has won my heart. Which is why I couldn’t wait to test Allrecipes’ top-rated cinnamon roll recipes to look for a winning go-to. Here’s what I found.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 cups dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>    
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in the butter; stir until melted. Add water and let cool until lukewarm.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the milk mixture, yeast, white sugar, salt, eggs and 2 cups flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into two pieces. Roll each piece into a 12x9 inch rectangle. In a bowl, stir together the cinnamon and brown sugar. Spread each piece with half of the butter, half of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough, using a little water to seal the seam.</li>            
        <li>Cut each roll into 12 slices using a very sharp knife or dental floss. Place rolls onto two 9x13 inch greased baking pans. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>To make frosting; combine confectioner's sugar, cream cheese, butter and vanilla. Add milk gradually until frosting reaches a spreading consistency. Spread over warm (but not hot) cinnamon rolls.</li>
    </ol>
